Used libs
---------

Parsing of gmi files and their rendering was performed by:

* Modified gemini-to-html by RangerMauve (AGPL license):
https://github.com/RangerMauve/gemini-to-html
To see my modifications, open gemini-to-html-parse.js and gemini-to-html-render.js
files in the directory with this file.

It has two dependencies:
* escape-goat by sindresorhus (MIT license):
https://github.com/sindresorhus/escape-goat
* slug by Trott (MIT license):
https://github.com/Trott/slug

Auto theme generator based on the one from kristall browser:

* kristall by MasterQ32 (GPL-3.0 license):
https://github.com/MasterQ32/kristall
Specifically, this function:
https://github.com/MasterQ32/kristall/blob/master/src/documentstyle.cpp#L515

It requires computing md5 hashes. For that, this library was used:
* JavaScript-MD5 by blueimp (MIT license):
https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-MD5

If you know how this combination of licenses dictate license for the whole product -
please let me know and use that. Otherwise, consider my addition to be under MIT,
zero-clause BSD, CC0, or WTFPL license, whichever you prefer.
